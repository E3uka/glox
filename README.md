# glox

An (according to the search results ðŸ‘€) very unoriginally named tree-walking interpreter for the Lox programming language written in Go.

Loosely following [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent), heavily leaning on go source code for inspo.
